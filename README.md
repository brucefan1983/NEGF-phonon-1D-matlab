# NEGF-phonon-1D-matlab
A 100-line Matlab code for phonon transport using the NEGF method in 1D atomic chain

## Features

* This is a simple but working code for calculating the phonon transmission in 1D homogeneous atomic chain using the NEGF (nonequilibrium Green's function) method. This method is also called the AGF (atomistic Green's function) method.
* This code was developed based on the RGF-electron-matlab code: https://github.com/brucefan1983/RGF-electron-matlab. So you see that phonon transport is very similar to electron transport.

## File organizations

* A script for testing:
  * test_ballistic.m: calculates the transmission in 1D homogeneous atomic chain

* The testing script calls
  * the driver function "find_T" to do the calculations

* The driver function "find_T" calls
  * the "find_H" function to construct the harmonic matrix
  * the "find_Sigma" function to calculate the self-energies of the leads
  * the "find_T1" function to calculate the transmission for a single phonon frequency
  
* The "find_Sigma" function calls 
  * the "find_g00" function to calculate the surface Green's function
  
## Unit system

* I use the following basic units:
  * Spring constant between two atoms: k=1
  * Mass of the atom: m=1

## Running the examples

* Run the "test_ballistc.m" script to get the ballistic transmission in in 1D homogeneous atomic chain.
